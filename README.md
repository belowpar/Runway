# Runway
An assignment from my data structures class that involves using linked queues and a priority system to simulate a one lane runway.
We were given the following description:
Simulate a small airport with one runway. Airplanes waiting to take off join a queue on the ground. Planes
waiting to land join a queue in the air. Only one plane can use the runway at any given time. All planes in the
air must land before any plane can take off.
We were also required to outline our classes and methods prior to creating the program. This is what the word document hw5a is.
